# Objective : Given a mac id and number of days find the list of mac id's that were co-located at the same place
# same time with the given mac id, along with total minutes (stationary + transition) list of minutes per day for
# those n days.

# Consider only the stationary periods of the given mac id

# bu test
# python3 main.py -m "xOiqnDUa" -s 20200605 -e 20200611 -l 5

# Imports
import pandas
import os
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import sys
import getopt
import contact_trace as ct

def main(argv):
    #print("Hello World")

    patient_mac = ""
    end = ""

    w = 0
    sess_length = 0
    oformat = "csv"

    # Read command line parameters
    # mac id : mostly patient mac id
    # start date for contact tracing
    # end date for contact tracing
    # w : window size for co-location overlap : Window size of 0 means strict co-location
    # same place , same time

    # Note on changes in cmd line args and compatibility with code written for earlier args
    # Earlier arguments were mac, num_days, backtrace date and window.
    # To incorporate the new cmd args and make it compatible
    # with the code, compute numdays from start and end date and
    # pass it to get_trace function.

    # Number of days you want to back trace
    # Date from which you want to back trace, this will be the last date in the trace
